# OWASP-Web
A software security game

UNDER DEVELOPMENT
 - Once complete the web app will feature all 10 OWASP vulnerabilities.


This small project was built to better my understanding of some of the common OWASP software security vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. The web application has 5 levels, each level requires the exploitation of a OWASP top 10 vulnerability to progress. Upon each level of advancement, a summary page will be displayed detailing what allowed the vulnerability exploitation and how to secure it and mitigate it.
